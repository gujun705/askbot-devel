this is a forked version of django-authopenid module
specifically for askbot forum project.

most likely it is not useful for anything else and
in fact will be phased out in askbot as well

Add by Mingze:
To use the ldap, you should add three parameters in django global settings.
##############
#LDAP
##############
LDAP_LOGIN_DN = "<domain>\<username>"
LDAP_PASSWORD = "<password>"
LDAP_DOMAIN = "<domain>"
